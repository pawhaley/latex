Suppose that we have some idealized elastic substance that can stretch in one dimension. (We donâ€™t worry about the volume of the material.) Let it have the equation of state $F=bT[\frac{L}{L_0}-(\frac{L_0}{L})^2]$ here $F$ is the force of tension, b is a positive constant, and the length $L_0$ at zero tension is a function only of the temperature $T$.  Calculate the amount of work required to compress the substance isothermally and  reversibly from $L = L_0$ to $L = \frac{1}{2}L_0$
