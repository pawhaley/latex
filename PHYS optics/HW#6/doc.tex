\section{8.5}
$$\tilde{E}=\frac{\hat{i}-\hat{j}}{\sqrt{2}}E_\circ e^{(\omega t+(x+y)/\sqrt{2}\lambda+\pi/2)i}$$
\section{8.9}
We are told that the angle between the light and the polariser is $60^\circ$ we also know that the intensity goes as $\cos^2(\theta)$ of the incident light.  So the intensity will be $(\cos(60))^2=(\frac{1}{2})^2=.25$ so $25\%$ of the light will be transmitted.
\section{8.14}
We will assume that the polariser is ideal given no other information.  We then see that there is a $60^\circ$ angle between the polariser and the incident light.  From the previous section we know that the intensity will be quartered to $50W/m^2$.
\section{8.18}
If we take non-polarized light and polarize it the intensity is reduced by the average value of $\cos^2(x)$ witch is $\frac{1}{2}$ so the first polariser reduces the intensity by .5.  if we then have a polariser at $50^\circ$ off of the previous one we will reduce the intercity by another $\cos^2(50)$ so our intensity will be $I=I_\circ\cdot.5cos^2(50^\circ)=207W/m^2$.  With the third polariser in place we then get $I=I_\circ\cdot.5cos^2(25^\circ)cos^2(25^\circ)=337W/m^2$.
\section{8.23}
The light leaving the paper has lost its polarization since the paper absorbs the light and then transmits the light.
\section{8.30}
This will be the Brewsterâ€™s angle so (8.25) $\tan(\theta)=n=1.39$.
\section{8.35}
In the crystal the ordinary waves have a index of 1.5443 so there wavelength is $381.60nm$ and there frequency is preserved at $c/\lambda=5.09E14Hz$.  The extraordinary light has a index of 1.5534 and so will have a wavelength of $379.36nm$ and the same frequency of $5.09E14Hz$.
\section{8.41}
The initial polariser will reduce the outgoing light by $1/2$ however the quarter wave plates will not reduce intensity and will simply rotate the light by $\pi/20$ thus oner it has gone through all of the plates it will be rotated by $\pi/2$ and be able to go through the last polariser.  So the total intensity will be reduced by 1/2.
