\section{Mesured Data}
We first attempted to get the focal length of the two lenses.  While doing this we recorded two positions of each instrument each with a uncertenty of .1cm this gives the average an uncertenty of $\delta=.1/\sqrt{2}$.\\

We mesured the position of the sourse as $ave(14.55cm, 18.45cm)=16.5cm \pm \delta$.\\

Next we set up our experament to mesure the focal lengths of the two lenses.  Below are the average distances (uncertenty $\delta$) to the mirror and the range of screen positions that focused $P_l$ to $P_h$.  We will not consider the uncertenty from the instrument's mesurements for these last two as the uncertenty we had in where they focused is much higher as shown below (order of mm vs cm).\\

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
 & lense & $P_l$ & $P_h$ & $P$ & $\delta P$\\
\hline
L1 & 37.55 & 149.45 & 159.25 & 154.35 & 4.9\\
\hline
 & 42.9 & 97.625 & 101.375 & 99.5 & 1.875\\
\hline
L2 & 37.55 & 148.25 & 158.55 & 153.4 & 5.15\\
\hline
& 42.05 & 98.35 & 102.95 & 100.65 & 2.3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\

We then mesured the distance to a virtual image.  To do this we calibrated the focus of a camera so that it focused in the range (59.675, 66.025).  Wich gives us a focus at $62.85\pm3.175$.  We then positioned the lense at various positions and mesured the distance to the virtual image formed by lense one.  The range in these mesurements is denoted $C_l$ to $C_h$.  Note that L has the previously described uncertenty $\delta$.\\

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
L & $C_l$ & $C_h$ & C & $\delta C$\\
\hline
17.45 & 59.575 & 65.525 & 62.55 & 2.975\\
\hline
22.45 & 53.575 & 61.775 & 57.675 & 4.1\\
\hline
27.45 & 40.875 & 48.975 & 44.925 & 4.05\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\

Finaly we positiond lense one neer the sourse then lense two and finaly the screen.  We set the positions of the lenses then experamentaly determind the distance where the image on the screen came into focus.  All of the set mesurements come with uncertenty $\delta$ the experamental vlaue has experamentaly determined uncertenty.\\

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
$L_1$ & $L_2$ & $S_l$ & $S_h$ & S & $\delta S$\\
\hline
32.3 & 52.3 & 71.8 & 72.55 & 72.175 & 0.375\\
\hline
23.05 & 58.9 & 86.95 & 87.85 & 87.4 & 0.45\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
