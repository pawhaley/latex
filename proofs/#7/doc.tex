Theorem.\\
If a is a non zero integer then $a|a$.\\
Proof.\\
Assume a is some non zero integer.  Since one is the multiplicative identity we can say $1\cdot a=a$.  Note that one is an integer.  Thus by definition $a|a$.\\

Theorem.\\
If a, b, and c are non zero integers such that $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$\\
Proof.\\
Suppose a, b, and c are non zero integers such that $a|b$ and $b|c$.  By definition $a\cdot m=b$ for some integer $m$.  By definition $b\cdot n=c$ for some integer $n$.  Note that $a\cdot m \cdot n=c$.  Also note that the multiple of two in integers is a integer thus $m\cdot n$ is a integer.  By definition $a|c$.\\
