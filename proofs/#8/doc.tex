Theorem.\\
If m and n are relatively prime and both divide k then k is divisible by mn.\\
Proof.\\
Suppose m and n are relatively prime and both divide k.\\
By definition of divides note that there exist a i and l such that $i m=k$ and $l n=k$.  Since m and n are relatively prime we can say by definition that there exist $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $am+bn=1$.  Note that $am+bn=1 \Rightarrow kam+kbn=k1 \Rightarrow (ln)am+(im)bn=k \Rightarrow (la+ib)mn=k$ noting that $la+ib$ is a integer we may say by definition $mn|k$.\\ $\Box$
