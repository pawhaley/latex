Theorem. If A and B are sets where $A\cap B=A$ then $A \subseteq B$.

Proof.

Suppose A and B are sets where $A\cap B=A$.

To show $A \subseteq B$.

Chuse $x\in A$.  By our assumption that $A\cap B=A$, x must also be an element of $A\cap B$.  By the deffinition of intersection $x\in A\wedge x\in B$ by simplification we can remove $x\in A$.  Thus $x\in B$.  Since x was chosen arbitraraly from A and we showd that it followd that x is in B we conclude $A\subseteq B$.\\$\Box$
